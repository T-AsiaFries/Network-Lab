# Network-Lab
My small business network created in GNS3

## Network Topology

- Establishing a WAN-CLOUD linked to a WAN-SWITCH allowing for centralized management and control of wide area network (WAN) connections, efficient routing, and traffic prioritization across geographically dispersed locations.

2. Adding a FortiGate firewall and linked it to my WAN-SWITCH to act as the first line of defense to protect my computers, devices and data.

3. Linked my LAN and DMZ ports on the firewall to the corresponding switches I added to enable secure and segmented communication between different network zones while enforcing strict access controls and traffic policies.

4. Adding my Win10-1 workstation and linking it to the LAN-SWITCH to ensure the workstation can communicate effectively with other devices and applications within the LAN environment while maintaining security protocols and access permissions.
