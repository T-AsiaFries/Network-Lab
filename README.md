# Network-Lab
My small business network created in GNS3

## Network Topology

1. Establishing a WAN-CLOUD linked to a WAN-SWITCH allowing for centralized management and control of wide area network (WAN) connections, efficient routing, and traffic prioritization across geographically dispersed locations.

2. Adding a FortiGate firewall and linked it to my WAN-SWITCH to act as the first line of defense to protect my computers, devices and data.

3. Linked my LAN and DMZ ports on the firewall to the corresponding switches to enable secure and segmented communication between different network zones while enforcing strict access controls and traffic policies.
